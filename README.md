Practising JavaScript by completing Reddit Daily Programmer Challenge #240. The description of the challenge is as follows:

Typoglycemia is a relatively new word given to a purported recent discovery about how people read written text. As wikipedia puts it:
The legend, propagated by email and message boards, purportedly demonstrates that readers can understand the meaning of words in a sentence even when the interior letters of each word are scrambled. As long as all the necessary letters are present, and the first and last letters remain the same, readers appear to have little trouble reading the text.

Or as Urban Dictionary puts it:
Typoglycemia
The mind's ability to decipher a mis-spelled word if the first and last letters of the word are correct.
The word Typoglycemia describes Teh mdin's atbiliy to dpeihecr a msi-selpeld wrod if the fsirt and lsat lteetrs of the wrod are cerorct.

Input Description:
Any string of words with/without punctuation.

Output Description:
A scrambled form of the same sentence but with the word's first and last letter's positions intact.

For my solution, I opted to include some jQuery to allow the user to input a desired sentence to scramble into their browser.
